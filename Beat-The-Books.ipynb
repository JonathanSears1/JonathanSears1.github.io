    "### Project Plan\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to find a way to profit of of sports betting. There are several reasons I want to do this. First I want to make money, I feel like that is pretty self explanatory. Additionally, sports books and casinos always stack the odds in their favor, so I think it would be cool to find a way to beat them at their own game. "

    "### The Plan\n",
    "My approach to beat the books will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Build a couple different machine learning models. One that given some data we can aquire before a game starts, predicts the winner of a game (moneyline), one that predicts the point differential (spread), and one that predicts the total number of points (over under). \n",
    "2) Scrape the odds from many different sportsbooks. Since sportsbooks operate independently, their odds are constantly changing. Exploting these discrepencies to get the best odds for any bet is essential if you want to beat the books. \n",
    "3) Using some math I'm going to calculate my predicted expected value for a given bet, if the expected value > 0, then I will classify it as a winning bet. Theoretically, if I place enough bets and my model is accurate, I should be able to beat the books. "

    "### Expected Value and the Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "There is some important math we will need to have a strong understanding of during this project. The plus EV strategy relies on identifying bets with positive expected values, so it's important to have a strong understanding of what expected values are. The expected value of a bet will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    EV = P(event A happens)* (Payoff of event A) + P(event B) * (Payoff of event B)\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at this we can see how important it is to properly asses the probability of a given event happening is, as that's what will be the real difference between making and losing money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important tool is the law of large numbers, which states that the more bets we place, the higher probability we have of reaching our expected value. This is important because while we might have a positive EV on a bet this doesn't guarantee that it will hit. What the law of large numbers is saying that if we place 1000 bets with 50% probability of hitting, then we have an incredibly high probability of hitting around 500 of them. Basically, the more bets we place, the closer we should get to converging to our expected value.  "

    "# Data\n",
    "The two datasets I found that I think will come in handy for this project are the 538 ELO model dataset and the spreadspoke historical odds dataset. Unfortunately I can't use the 538 ELO model as a predictor when building my own model, as it was discontinued before the 2023 NFL season. However, I think it could still be useful to compare it to my own model to get a gaugue of how well I'm doing. The spreadspoke dataset will likely be one of the most important finds for this whole project as historical odds, spreads, and over under lines will come in extremely handy when building my own model. Finding free data about the NFL turned out to be a lot harder than I thought. I couldn't find any datasets that had historical box scores or anything like that, so instead I decided to make my own by using webscraping. Lastly I needed to find a way to get current odds of NFL games from a wide range of sportsbooks. The Odds API came in extremely handy for this"

We need data that can be collected before the game starts. However, we can use data from previous games to get an idea of how a team performs on average. For example if we want to look at how a team performs on average on third downs we can look at the average from their previous 5, 10, 15, etc. games."
